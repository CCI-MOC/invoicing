        Takes in an invoice and a list of PI projects that are a subset of it,
        and applies a flat discount to those PI projects. Note that this function
        will change the provided `invoice` Dataframe directly. Therefore, it does
        not return the changed invoice.

        This function assumes that the balance field shows the remaining cost of the project,
        or what the PI would pay before the flat discount is applied.

        If the optional parameters `code_field` and `discount_code` are passed in,
        `discount_code` will be comma-APPENDED to the `code_field` of projects where
        the discount is applied

        Returns the amount of discount used.
